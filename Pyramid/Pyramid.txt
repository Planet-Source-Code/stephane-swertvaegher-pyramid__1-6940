The game is to reach the end point in the puzzle.
There are 50 levels. Each level has a different layout.
You start at the bottom line of the puzzle. Click the matching color, and move on.
Find your way through the colors and try to reach the end point.
There's a time limit !
You can encounter:
- A color changer. The working color will be changed, and you have to move on
with that color. Sometimes it is smart to change the color more then once.
- A skull. This will reset the level. You have to start over.

When you are trapped, hit the Reset-button. This will reset the level, and you can start
the puzzle all over.

A LEVEL-RESET WILL NOT RESET THE TIME !!!

When your time is up, you will loose a life.
Every 5 levels, you have a new life, for a max. of 9 lives.
